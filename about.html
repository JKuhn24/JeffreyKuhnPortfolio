<h2>About Me</h2>
<h3>Why Coding?</h3>
<p>Technology itself has always been a very big interest of mine. I wanted to do something that I would enjoy as well as be passionate about.
I decided on coding because it matches both of those criteria while also allowing me to work with technology.</p>
<h3>Goals</h3>
<p>My goal of coding is to eventually get a job in IT that would put me in a position to work on technology for a living.
My primary goal of learning code is to eventually be the one to create or at least help make a video game. I'd like to give back to the
industry that was a big part of my life growing up.</p>
<h3>Hobbies</h3>
<p>My main hobby is playing video games. Outside of things such as class I'm usually spending time playing games, learning about current
topics in the industry or just simply learning about the technology that's being used to run the games I'm playing. If I'm not playing games
I'm usually spending time with friends.</p>
